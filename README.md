# pathfinding-visualizer
A python application built using pygame to visualize pathfinding algorithms.

Algorithms:
- A: AStar
- D: Dijkstras
- G: Best First Search
- S: Greedy Best First (Snake)
- B: Breadth First Search
- P: Depth First Search

- C: Clear board
- LeftClick: Place(start, end, barrier)
- RightClick: Remove
- Middle Click: Add weight(sometimes may be cleared if the algorithm doesn't support it, such as Breadth First Search)
- Space: Go
